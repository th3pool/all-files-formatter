It is really simple:, just install the extension, run the command, confirm, and thats it

### step 2

A pop-up window will show up, asking you to confirm the action. If you don't have a default formatter, the extension will ask you to choose/install one.

> Note: You still need to have a formatter for each type of file you want to format, as `Prettier` for js/ts

### step 3

The extension will automatically open, format, and close all the files for you, ignoring the same files in your `.gitignore` file.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

_`Automatically close files`_: Should we close each file after it is formatted?  
_`ignore pattern`_: Add more ignore patters so those files also get ignored.  
_`Include Gitignore`_: Check the `.gitignore` file to ignore the same files as git does.
